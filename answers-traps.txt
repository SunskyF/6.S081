RISC-V assembly:
1. Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
a1, a2 ...
a2

2. Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)
call to f:
26:	45b1                	li	a1,12

call to g:
14:	250d                	addiw	a0,a0,3

3. At what address is the function printf located?
0x630

4. What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?
38

5. Run the following code.
HE110 World
e100 is the hex of 57616, if big-endian, the value should be e100,0000
0x00646c72: 
    64: d, 6c: l, 72 r 

6. In the following code, what is going to be printed after
x=3 y=5221
the address of arg2 is random
